## Tips & Tricks

### üí° Pro Tips
- **Use descriptive task names**: Clear descriptions make it easier to find tasks later
- **Be specific with dates**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for consistent date handling
- **Regular reviews**: Use `list` frequently to stay on top of your tasks
- **Search effectively**: Use `find` with specific keywords to locate tasks quickly
- **Sort strategically**: Use `sort date asc` to see upcoming deadlines first

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Enter**: Send command
- **Up/Down arrows**: Navigate through command history (if supported)

### üìÖ Date Formats
- **Deadline dates**: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-09-20`)
- **Event times**: `YYYY-MM-DD HHmm` (e.g., `2025-09-20 1400`)
- **Natural language**: You can also use formats like `today`, `tomorrow`, or `next week`

## FAQ

### ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I edit a task after creating it?**
A: Currently, you cannot directly edit tasks. Instead, delete the old task and create a new one with the corrected information.

**Q: What happens if I enter an invalid date?**
A: Yoyo will show an error message and ask you to use the correct date format (YYYY-MM-DD for deadlines, YYYY-MM-DD HHmm for events).

**Q: Can I have multiple tasks with the same name?**
A: Yes, Yoyo allows duplicate task names. Each task gets a unique number for identification.

**Q: How many tasks can I store?**
A: There's no strict limit, but for optimal performance, we recommend keeping under 1000 tasks.

**Q: Does Yoyo save my tasks automatically?**
A: Yes! All your tasks are automatically saved to a file called `yoyo.txt` in the data directory.

**Q: What if I accidentally delete a task?**
A: Deleted tasks cannot be recovered. Make sure to double-check before using the `delete` command.

**Q: Can I use Yoyo on different devices?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to copy the `yoyo.txt` file to share your tasks between devices.

## Troubleshooting

### üîß Common Issues & Solutions

#### "OOPS!!! I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means :-("
**Cause**: You entered an unrecognized command.
**Solution**: Type `help` to see all available commands, or check your spelling.

#### "Invalid task number"
**Cause**: You're trying to mark/unmark/delete a task that doesn't exist.
**Solution**: Use `list` to see all tasks and their numbers, then use the correct number.

#### "A todo needs a description"
**Cause**: You tried to create a todo without providing a description.
**Solution**: Add a description after the `todo` command, e.g., `todo Buy milk`.

#### "Usage: deadline <description> /by <yyyy-MM-dd>"
**Cause**: Incorrect deadline command format.
**Solution**: Use the format: `deadline <description> /by <YYYY-MM-DD>`

#### "Usage: event <description> /from <yyyy-MM-dd HHmm> /to <yyyy-MM-dd HHmm>"
**Cause**: Incorrect event command format.
**Solution**: Use the format: `event <description> /from <YYYY-MM-DD HHmm> /to <YYYY-MM-DD HHmm>`

#### Tasks not saving
**Cause**: File write permissions or disk space issues.
**Solution**: Check that you have write permissions in the application directory and sufficient disk space.
